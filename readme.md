## Websockets 
Supports these  
this is currently a  placeholder for a new project - Socket Drawer.

The idea behind it is providing a basic framework (ala express)
for projects using sockjs (and hopefully socket.io later on).

The framework will provide capabilities such as session management, 
request mapping and handling and middleware-like functionality.

All of the above is already available in the code but it isnt packed yet
as a node package.

If youd like to try it out now feel free. I will hopefully get around to 
polishing, documenting and packaging it soon.

stay tuned.
